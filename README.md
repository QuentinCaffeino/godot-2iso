Normal to isometric texture converter
===================

![App screenshot](https://github.com/QuentinCaffeino/godot-2iso/blob/master/2isoScreenshot.png)

#### **How to use**
1. Clone project
2. Copy images you want to convert to project directory
3. Open editor
4. Run
5. ???
5. After converting image you will see `Dst` folder appear. All generated images will be there.

 **Why do you need to copy images to project folder?**
Unfortunately it seems that godot can't load images that doesn't have `.import` and `.stex` file.

----------

#### **Todo**

 - Make all images the same size in preview

##### Suggestions are welcome
